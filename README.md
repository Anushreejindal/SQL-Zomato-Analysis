# SQL Project: Zomato Country Wise Restaurant Analysis

**Author**: Anushree Jindal <br>
**Dataset Used**: [Zomato Country Wise Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iottech/zomato-country-wise-dataset)

## Project Overview
This project presents a structured SQL analysis of Zomato’s country-wise restaurant data, uncovering meaningful insights across 15 countries. The goal is to explore how restaurant trends, customer preferences, and service features vary from country to country.

Through SQL queries, the project answers key questions like:

1. Which countries have the highest or lowest number of restaurants?
2. How do average ratings and price ranges differ across countries?
3. Where are services like online delivery and table booking more common?
4. What cuisines dominate each country, and where are certain cuisines underserved?
5. Which countries have a high volume of restaurants but lag in customer satisfaction?

The project uses joins, aggregations, subqueries, and filtering to reveal patterns in restaurant distribution, cuisine popularity, pricing, and service quality — all with a country-wise lens.

This analysis can help stakeholders identify market opportunities, improve service offerings, and understand consumer behavior across different regions.
